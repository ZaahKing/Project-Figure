        <h2>Conception</h2>
        <p>You may choose your own rithm of study. But I advise you to memorize in four stages:</p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>You have imagine two associations with each side of the card and then merge them to one form in your mind. At the same time loudly say for yourself text from the card.</li>
            <li>Actually this point is optional. You may repeat learning before the night sleep. Now you got this information in short-term memory.</li>
            <li>To get it to long-term memory you have to test this knowledge four days for one time each and a week later one time. </li>
            <li>Now you know it good. But you can forget it if will not repeat testing time to time. A month later or year it depend on you but you have to repeat. Good reason to test foreign is a travel for exemple.</li>
        </ol></p>
